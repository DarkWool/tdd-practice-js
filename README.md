# Testing Practice Project (TDD)

This was the perfect project to give my first steps in Test Driven Development using **Jest**.

## Specifications

1. Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

   1. A `capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

   1. A `reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

   1. A `calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: _add_, _subtract_, _divide_, and _multiply_. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

   1. A `caesarCipher` function that takes a string and returns it with each character “shifted”. Read more about how a Caesar cipher works on this website.

      1. Don’t forget to test wrapping from z to a.
      1. Don’t forget to test keeping the same case.
      1. Don’t forget to test punctuation!

   1. An `analyzeArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: _average_, _min_, _max_, and _length_.

      ```
      const object = analyzeArray([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

      object == {
      average: 4,
      min: 1,
      max: 8,
      length: 6
      };
      ```
